These instructions will assume a Windows environment, but note that these steps can be easily adapted for macOS or Linux.

==== Download & Install VirtualBox

Browse to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and click on 'Windows hosts' to download the VirtualBox installer. Run the installer to install VirtualBox using the default installation options.

==== Download & Run TSX Virtual Machine

Download the TSX workflow virtual machine at: https://tsx.org.au/tsx-desktop.ova

Go to the folder where the TSX workflow virtual machine was downloaded and double-click to open it. If you have installed VirtualBox correctly, a screen with "Appliance Settings" should open up. Use the defaults, or for better performance adjust the CPU setting to match the number of CPU cores on your system. Click on the Import button. This process may take several minutes (up to 10 minutes depending on your computer).

After importing the virtual machine into VirtualBox, double click on tsx-desktop to start it. After a few seconds to minutes (depending on computer), it should start up and display a terminal:

That's it! You can now skip straight to <<Running the workflow>>.
